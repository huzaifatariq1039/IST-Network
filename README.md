# IST Network Model - Semester Project

## Overview
This project is a detailed simulation of the network infrastructure for the Institute of Space Technology (IST). The model is designed to emulate a real-world network architecture, with each department functioning as a subnet, inter-departmental connections established through routers, and a central server room for data storage and broadcasting.

## Features
- **Departmental Subnets**: Each department has its own subnet, complete with PCs, laptops, routers, and switches to simulate a realistic network.
- **Central Server Room**: A centralized server room stores all departmental data and can broadcast messages to all departments.
- **Inter-Department Connectivity**: Routers connect the departmental subnets, ensuring seamless communication across the network.
- **Realistic Hardware Simulation**: Includes PCs, laptops, routers, and switches to represent the network components accurately.

## Network Topology
- **Departments**: Each department is represented as a subnet with specific IP addressing schemes.
- **Centralized Server Room**: Houses departmental servers and provides broadcasting functionality.
- **Inter-Departmental Routers**: Ensure communication between departments.


## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Network Simulation Software**: Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Configuration Files**: Scripts and configuration files are present in the report
